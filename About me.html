            <p>
                Hey! Welcome to my page and nice to meet you here!
                Some brief introduction about me:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Composer: I started my journey with music since 4, and was in a municipal choir. 
                        Even though I quitted due to some personal issues, I restarted to pursue my dream since the pandemic by learning guitar and ukelele. 
                        During my sophomore year, I got into composing and arranging music by chance, which exposed me to a variety of different genres and helped me make many friends. 
                        Music has been a very important element in my growth. If you also enjoy music, feel free to discuss it with me!
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Positive: Iâ€™m often told by my friends that I am the most optimistic person they have ever met and I always provide them the greatest emotional support. 
                        Throughout my growth, I have faced various challenges: eating disorder, being manipulated (PUA), anxiety that manifested physically, etc. 
                        My environment has also undergone several major changes, requiring me to constantly adjust and adapt. 
                        But despite all of this, I still believe that the best is yet to come.
                        If you are also experiencing a hard time and want someone to talk to, then I guess I would be your good choice. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Something else: My result for the MBTI test is ISFJ, and my constellation is Aries. 
                        I know some simple forms of divination, such as tarot, pendulum reading, and basic astrology charts.
                        I also enjoy new and exciting activities, like go-karting and bungee jumping.
